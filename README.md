# SpartronicsLogo
High-quality SVG and PNG versions (most components exported directly from the original PhotoShop document for the shapes; the text is a very close reproduction) of the Spartronics logos.

The non-web safe SVG files require the font [SF Transrobotics](https://www.dafont.com/sf-transrobotics.font) to be displayed properly (and thus **should not be used online** at \[least without significant modification\]), while the web safe versions have the font converted to vector paths and will render correctly in any browser released since 2011.

I am not sure who made the Spartronics logo, but it is based on our school's logo. I created the files here based on the source files, and also created the mask version, using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/).
